/**
You will have to define the functions inside your header file.
You cannot separate definition of template functions in to the source file and declarations in to header file.

When a template is used in a way that triggers its intstantation, a compiler needs to see that particular templates definition. This is the reason templates are often defined in the header file in which they are declared.

Reference:
C++03 standard, § 14.7.2.4:

The definition of a non-exported function template, a non-exported member function template, or a non-exported member function or static data member of a class template shall be present in every translation unit in which it is explicitly instantiated.
